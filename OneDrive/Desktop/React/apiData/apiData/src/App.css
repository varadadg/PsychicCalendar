Certainly! Here's a React.js app challenge that involves manipulating an API response and displaying it in a different form. In this challenge, you'll be working with an API that returns a list of users. Your task is to fetch the user data from the API, manipulate the response, and display it in a different format.

**Challenge: User List Transformation App**

**API Endpoint:**

For this challenge, let's assume the API endpoint that returns a list of users is `https://api.example.com/users`.

**Requirements:**

1. **Fetching Data**: Create a React app that fetches the list of users from the API endpoint mentioned above.

2. **Display Original Data**: Display the original list of users as received from the API in a tabular format. Show at least the following user details for each user: Name, Email, and Phone.

3. **Data Transformation**: Implement a transformation logic to modify the user data. The transformation should be as follows:
   - Capitalize the first letter of each user's name.
   - Hide the last two digits of each user's phone number with asterisks (e.g., 123-456-7890 should become 123-456-****).

4. **Display Transformed Data**: Show the transformed user data in a new tabular format, similar to the original data, but with the modifications applied.

5. **Error Handling**: Handle any errors that may occur during the API fetch process and display an appropriate error message to the user if the data cannot be retrieved.

6. **Loading State**: Display a loading indicator while the data is being fetched from the API.

7. **Styling**: Feel free to add CSS styling to make the app visually appealing.

**Tips:**

- Use `fetch` or any other suitable method to make the API request from your React app.

- You can use the `map` function to loop through the list of users and apply the required transformations.

- To capitalize the first letter of each name, you can create a helper function or use JavaScript's string manipulation functions.

- To hide the last two digits of the phone number, you can use JavaScript's string methods like `slice()` or regular expressions.

- Use React state to store the fetched data, loading state, and any error messages that need to be displayed.

**Bonus:**

If you complete the main challenge and want an extra challenge, you can consider the following enhancements:

- Add pagination or infinite scrolling to display the users in a more manageable way, especially if the API returns a large number of users.

- Implement sorting functionality to allow users to sort the user list based on name, email, or phone number.

- Add search functionality to filter users based on their names or other criteria.

- Provide options for the user to choose different transformations, such as changing the capitalization style or hiding different digits of the phone number.

Have fun building the User List Transformation App! It will test your API handling skills and your ability to manipulate and present data in different forms using React.js.
